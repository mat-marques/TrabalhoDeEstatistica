[1]. The following table represents the probability mass function for a discrete random variable
X.

x    |   0   1    2    3    4    5  |
fX(x)| 0.06 0.17 0.22 0.28 0.17 0.1 |

(a) Verify that the table represents indeed a probability mass function.
(b) Plot the probability mass function.
(c) Obtain and plot the cumulative distribution function for X.
(d) Determine the mean, variance, and standard deviation of X.
(e) Determine the skewness and kurtosis of the probability mass function.
(f) Determine the expectation E[g(X)] for the function g(X) = X^2 + X.
