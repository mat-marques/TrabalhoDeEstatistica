[17] As a water resources engineer for the state of Utah, you analyze the water surface
elevation at a location of the Colorado river in South Eastern Utah and decide to divide the
ranges of possible water surface elevations into the following sets:

Let WS represent water surface elevation in ft:
A1 = { WS < 2500 ft}
A2 = { 2500 ft ≤ WS < 2600 ft }
A3 = { 2600 ft ≤ WS < 2700 ft }
A4 = { WS ≥ 2700 ft}

Data for the monthly maximum water surface elevation from the last ten years show that the
water surface elevation at the point of interest was determine to belong to the four ranges
detailed above with the following frequencies:

n1 = n(A1) = 10
n2 = n(A2) = 120
n3 = n(A3) = 80
n4= n(A4) = 30

Using the frequency definition of probability, and based on this 20-year data, determine the
following probabilities:
(a) P(A1)
(b) P(A1 ∪ Α3 )
(c) P(A1 ∩ Α3)
(d) P(A1^c)
